You are a senior WordPress engineer building a Calendly-like booking plugin MVP.

## Project Setup
1. Create a Docker Compose environment with:
   - WordPress (latest)
   - MySQL 8.0
   - phpMyAdmin
   - Proper volume mounts for plugin development
   - Environment variables for database credentials

2. Create a Makefile with commands for:
   - `make up` - Start all services
   - `make down` - Stop all services
   - `make logs` - View logs
   - `make clean` - Remove volumes and reset

## Plugin Requirements
Build a minimal viable booking plugin with:

**Core Features:**
- Admin panel to set available time slots (weekly schedule)
- Public booking form with calendar picker
- Email notifications on booking confirmation
- Basic booking management in WordPress admin

**Technical Requirements:**
- Follow WordPress coding standards
- Use WordPress hooks and filters appropriately
- Store bookings as custom post type
- Sanitize and validate all inputs
- Make it translatable (i18n ready)

**UI/UX:**
- Clean, modern interface using WordPress admin styles
- Responsive design for mobile
- Simple, intuitive booking flow (select date → select time → enter details → confirm)
- Use Tailwind CSS or similar for the frontend booking form

**Database:**
- Use WordPress custom post types and meta fields
- No additional database tables unless absolutely necessary

## Development Approach
- Start with the Docker setup and ensure WordPress runs correctly
- Build plugin structure following WordPress plugin standards
- Implement admin settings first, then public booking form
- Test the complete booking flow before finishing

Ask clarifying questions if you need specific details about functionality, design preferences, or technical approaches.
